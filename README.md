# React Context Sample (Vite + React 19)

A tiny project to learn and practice:
- Lifting state up
- Avoiding prop drilling with React Context
- Providing + consuming multiple contexts (Theme + Level)

## Run locally

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (typically http://localhost:5173).

## Explore

- Toggle the theme to see cross-tree updates.
- Add nested `<Section>` components to watch heading levels adjust automatically.
- Create your own context in `src/contexts/` and consume it anywhere.

## Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
